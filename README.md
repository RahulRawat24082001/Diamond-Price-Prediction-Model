Diamond Price Prediction Model
Overview :
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on various features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, etc. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in estimating the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.

Dataset :
This dataset includes information about thousands of diamonds, including their prices and various attributes that affect their value.

Model Development
The diamond price prediction model is developed using Python and the following key libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Files
diamond_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
diamonds.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.

Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
Open diamond_price_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and train the model.
Future Improvements
Future updates to this project may include:

Fine-tuning model hyperparameters for better performance.
Exploring advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods or neural networks.
Deploying the model as a web application or API for real-time diamond price predictions.
